Welcome! I'm a Ph.D. student in Real Estate and Urban Land Economics at the Wisconsin School of Business, [UW-Madison](https://www.wisc.edu/). 

Prior to joining the program, I was an economist at the Bank of Korea, the central bank of South Korea. I received B.B.A. in Business Administration from Yonsei University and M.S. in Finance from KAIST College of Business.
