Welcome! I'm a fourth-year Ph.D. student in Real Estate and Urban Land Economics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. 

Prior to joining the program, I received B.B.A. in Business Administration from Yonsei University and M.S. in Finance from KAIST College of Business. Also, I had worked at the Bank of Korea, the central bank of South Korea.
