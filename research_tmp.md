  <div style="margin-left: 1em; font-size: 0.9em">
 This paper examines how frictions encountered during the initial purchase mortgage origination process shape borrowers’ future refinancing behavior and contribute to wealth disparities. Leveraging variation in loan officer workload as a quasi-random source of lender-induced origination delays, I find that experiencing a 60+ day delay lowers quarterly refinancing rates by 16–24%. Minority borrowers, low-income households, and those with lower credit scores are more likely to encounter such frictions, with evidence pointing to lender bias as a potential driver of racial disparities. A structural model implies a present value loss of $6,641 per delayed borrower, which amounts to $2.8 billion in overpayments each year when scaled to the U.S. market. Importantly, these losses are not evenly distributed: conditional on the same delay event, minority borrowers incur greater financial losses than White borrowers, largely due to a lower baseline likelihood of acting on refinancing opportunities. Together, these findings demonstrate how subtle frictions in the origination process can lead to persistent financial disadvantages and entrench wealth inequality.
